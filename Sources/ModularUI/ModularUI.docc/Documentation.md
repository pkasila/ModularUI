# ``ModularUI``

A framework which allows you to build modular apps in SwiftUI faster.

## Overview

Modularity is a great feature to have when you create complex apps
containing different, let's call them, "mini-apps" inside of them.

You can split, for example, newsfeed, messages, profile and other
features of your app into different modules, which will be accessible
through the main app.

ModularUI let's you do this in a convinient way, basically you need
to use ``ModularView`` inside you app, and it will handle everything
automatically.
